    <p><b>Bio:</b> I am an Entrepreneur with a passion to build things so I chose the construction sector as my muse which gives me limitless possibilites to build. I started by building solar lanterns and robots with Lego Mindstorms and then
      graduated to help build- homes, rural solar micro-grids, solar power plants,high-voltage transmission lines and substations,mobile-solar water purifier. Now, I am building an eco-system to solve the painpoints in home construction and home
      improvement sectors. Dream is to help build a million homes! Primarily for the low and middle income groups and help them build their first home </p>
